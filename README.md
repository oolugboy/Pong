# Pong

This is an attempt to recreate the classis 2 dimensional pong game using the Modern OpenGL Library.

The main purpose of this project is to give me a head start in getting myself familiar with the rudimentary computer graphics concepts and also to get me started in building the skills needed to be able to work on better and more complex game engines.
